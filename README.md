Nowadays, health diseases are increasing day by day due to life style, hereditary. Especially, heart disease has become more common these days. Each individual has different values for Blood pressure, cholesterol and pulse rate. In health care system there is large amount of data but poor in knowledge. The reason behind it is lack of effective analysis system to discover hidden relationship and data. Because of these data mining is used for the extracting and analyzing the knowledge. Numbers of data mining techniques are used like decision tree, Na√Øve Bayes, KNN, K-means, BP algorithm. But neural network is one of the most important techniques in data mining. We use the Intelligent Algorithm i.e., ANN (Artificial Neural Network). By using data mining techniques, it takes less time for the prediction of the disease with more accuracy.
